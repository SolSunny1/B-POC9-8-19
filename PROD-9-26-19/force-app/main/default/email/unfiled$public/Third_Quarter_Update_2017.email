<span style="font-family: Arial;"><b><font size="4">Third Quarter 2017 Update</font></b></span>
</div>
<font face="Arial" style=""><br />
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;">Each quarter we gather updates from across our businesses, including highlights from our operating businesses and our investment teams around the world, to share with our investors. This past quarter, we continued to find investing opportunities despite a competitive environment &ndash; due in large part to our strengths of size, global presence and operating platforms. We also made some good progress in a number of key areas, including closing on Terraform, a solar and wind power business we are very excited about. A few of our highlights are below:</span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
<b>Singles and Doubles</b></span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
Each quarter, we highlight companies and assets we have bought or sold, or countries we are investing in. These activities are incredibly important, but just as important is the execution of the business plans by the tens of thousands of people in our operating businesses. Without them, and the singles and doubles that are generated all the time, rarely would we achieve our plans. Here we highlight for you a few recent examples:</span>
</div>
<div style="">
<br />
<ul style="">
		
	
<li style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">We have finished construction on the first 800 of 4,200 kilometers of electricity transmission lines we are building in Brazil. These lines will bring electricity from the north to the load usage in the southeast. We bid on the concessions in 2015 and as a result of our financial wherewithal, our building expertise, and the strength of our reputation locally, we were awarded these licenses at an auction when few were bidding on anything in Brazil. We have now turned on the first 800 kilometers of lines, with an additional 800 kilometers expected to be completed by the end of the year. We are not done, but we are on budget and ahead of schedule &ndash; as a result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people. These lines are being built on
 mid-teen returns in local terms, and our total investment will be in the range of $1.2 billion.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>	 	
	<li style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">In 2015, we acquired a company called GrafTech, that makes graphite electrodes, for $1.25 billion. Graphite electrodes are a critical consumable with no known substitute that are
<span style="font-size: 13px;"> used in steel mini-mills to conduct electricity in the melting of scrap metal and other raw materials for the production of steel. The market was very weak in 2015 and 2016; we used this environment to restructure the company, exiting non-core businesses, shutting down capacity and improving plant productivity to achieve $100 million of annual operational improvements. The market for graphite electrodes has since tightened dramatically and steel producers are experiencing electrode shortages. We are now running flat out and prices have increased over four times from the bottom. If prices hold at these levels for 2018, and as current contracts roll off, we should earn well in excess of our target return on our $855 million equity investment. This turnaround,
 while in the early stages, looks like it could be very successful for us.<br />
		&nbsp;</span></li>	 	
	<li style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">In early 2016, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired a U.S. shopping mall in California that has been in substantial decline for several years. Despite its strong location, a lack of creative capital investment had driven customers elsewhere. In a transformative redevelopment program, we redesigned a substantial part of the mall, including two department stores, and re-planned the site to create a mixed-used
<span style="font-size: 13px;"> destination. We successfully completed the first phase of the project this year and are planning the 2018 commencement of the first of 1,500 residential units that are approved in the master plan. Over the next five years, we will invest approximately $500 million in the asset to create a vibrant, mixed-use community, centered around our new retail complex, and will generate approximately that same amount in profit. This project highlights how, with the right vision, </span>expertise<span style="font-size: 13px;"> and capital, retail assets can be re-invented and thrive as the retail sector evolves.<br />
		&nbsp;</span></li>	 	
	<li style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">We acquired a 325 megawatt<span style="font-size: 13px;"> wind turbine electricity business in Ireland in 2014 for $740 million. We financed it with </span>debt<span style="font-size: 13px;"> of $390 million and invested $350 million of equity. Since </span>acquisition
<span style="font-size: 13px;">, we have built out another 166 megawatts of new projects. We recently sold 137 megawatts of mature plants and crystalized 35% compounded annual return since acquisition. All told, we now have 370 megawatts operational in Ireland, an additional 78 megawatts under construction, cash flows are greater than when we started, and we have distributed over 50% of our original cash investment as a dividend to the owners. This has been a lot of work by many and so far, a very successful outcome.<br />
		&nbsp;</span></li>	 	
	<li style=""><span style="font-size: 13px;">In 2013 we acquired an industrial logistics property company in Europe. We invested further capital and dis</span><font size="2">tributed cash over the period. We started 7 million sq. ft. of new development projects and recently put the company up for sale due to very significant interest in this sector of the real estate market. We are now under firm contract to sell the company for a gross headline price of approximately &euro;2.4 billion which, takin</font>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">g all items into account, resulted in a 47% compound IRR and 4.5 times return on our equity capital. We continue to own our very large industrial business in the U.S. which has similarly undergone this transformation and are looking for opportunities to restart this business in Europe, as well as continue to grow in China and other markets.</span></li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
<b>SunEdison/TerraForm</b></span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
We often get asked how it is that we are able to acquire certain assets over others. Our investment in the TerraForm companies is a good example. We followed SunEdison and its affiliates for many years, as we participated in the same markets and in many cases competed for the same assets.&nbsp;</span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
In 2015, SunEdison encountered serious financial issues. We assessed the situation and considered whether we might participate in its reorganization as we have done with many companies, through acquiring their debt and eventually converting it to equity. Based on both our knowledge of the asset values in the company and at the trading values of the debt, we could not make the numbers work.</span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
After the bankruptcy of SunEdison, their two sponsored entities, TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global, traded down substantially. We knew the two companies had great assets and that the issue was primarily value. After the bankruptcy filing of SunEdison, the shares traded into a range where we finally saw value. This was the result of these two entities having two main issues: the first was that with the bankruptcy of their parent, they had no management. The second was that few investors trusted TerraForm&rsquo; s numbers as they were unable to file financial statements. We believed we could solve the first issue with our people, and on the second, our advantage was that we had deep knowledge of the assets and countries in which they were invested. As a result, we were able to make a
 much more informed assessment of value.</span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
At this point, we decided to buy common shares in the more liquid company TerraForm Power, and debt of TerraForm Global. In total, we acquired an original toe-hold of &plusmn;20% of TerraForm Power and debt of TerraForm Global. We eventually made proposals to the boards of both companies and their creditors, and ultimately were chosen to sponsor a recapitalization.</span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
All this led us to recently conclude the purchase of 51% of TerraForm Power, and we will act as its new sponsor. We also expect to shortly close the acquisition of 100% of TerraForm Global. In aggregate, this will expand our renewable operations by 3,600 megawatts with an investment of $1.4 billion.&nbsp;</span>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><br />
The overall portfolio is primarily in our core markets of the U.S., Brazil and India, but also expands our operations in a modest way into Uruguay, China, Thailand, Malaysia and South Africa. Over time, we will consider each of these markets and either grow or sell, depending on our assessment of the opportunity looking forward. We are thrilled with the acquisition which, all told, took close to two years to conclude.</span>
</div>

<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 13px;">To date, Brookfield has made a $200 million investment in Prumo Par,<sup>i</sup> $50 million of which has been placed into BID US and is currently performing above our target expectations.<sup>ii</sup> Additionally, we have recently committed to a &euro;45 million debt investment related to the acquisition of Autovia del Camino (a toll road in northern Spain), which we expect to place into BID Euro.<sup>iii</sup> The global pipeline of investment opportunities for the BID Funds remains strong and the team has reviewed over 170 potential transactions since inception.<sup>iv</sup> Furthermore, we are actively negotiating term sheets on several prospective deals.<sup>v</sup>

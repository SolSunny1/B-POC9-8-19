    <textOnly>First Quarter 2018 Update
 
Each quarter we provide an update to our investors on our investing activities and share our perspectives on our approach to investing. This quarter, we focus on our approach to global investing, which has played a significant role in enabling us to continue finding compelling investment opportunities despite a competitive environment.
 
Global Investing
 
The impact of politics on business seems to be on every investor&#39;s mind today. This is always the case to a certain extent, but Brexit, U.S. trade tariffs, NAFTA, China, Syria and others that are in daily social media and news headlines seem to be making investors even more preoccupied.

With respect to our operations, we are micro, rather than macro, investors. Of course, broad economic trends affect all of our businesses, but what is more important to our long-term success is our ability to find great businesses in good countries that will stand the test of time, irrespective of short-term politics. While in the long term, negative political situations could impact our businesses, in the short to medium term, politics are, for the most part, irrelevant to us and our business plans. In fact, the short-term noise frequently provides opportunities to acquire assets at reduced valuations (or to sell them for premium returns).

With respect to entering new countries, it takes a great deal of effort to establish our operations. We therefore try to choose countries wisely, stay forever, and grow incrementally in order to prevent mistakes early on. 

There are three important factors we always consider when entering a country. These include its size, a culture of respect for capital (also sometimes referred to as a rule of law, but it&#39;s more than that), and the ability to operate with the high global ethical standards we adhere to everywhere we do business. 

Having a global franchise provides us with an enormous competitive advantage. It offers us both diversification and the ability to find value in markets that few others operate in. This is important, as different regions go through different economic cycles at different times. Our global franchise allows us to scale up our investing activities in markets when things are tougher and returns therefore should be better. Conversely, it allows us to harvest capital in markets that are more fully priced. In all of this, the critical point is that we are able to turn ideas into actionable opportunities. 

Ensuring that we adhere to the above principles gives us a common basis to measure our successes and our mistakes. Over time, this continuously makes us better and gives us a definable competitive advantage.

GGP
 
In 2009, we acquired a 34% stake in GGP, one of the largest Class A mall operators in the U.S. Coming out of the recession, this has turned out to be a great investment and a business that is complementary to our other real estate businesses. Late last year, we made a bid to acquire the remaining 66% of GGP that we do not already own from the other shareholders. In March, after negotiations with the independent directors of GGP and their advisors, we agreed to a revised transaction and the independent directors of GGP have recommended to shareholders that they approve it. 

Our offer is approximately 61% in cash and 39% in units of Brookfield Property Partners (BPY) or shares of a newly created Brookfield Property REIT. This REIT will be economically equivalent to an investment in BPY but qualify as a U.S. REIT security. Total consideration for the equity of the non-Brookfield owned shares is $15 billion. 

To complete this transaction we partnered with a number of our investors and sold them interests in $4 billion of retail centers. We borrowed on a term basis another $5 billion and will, post-closing, sell interests in other assets to investors. This is a large transaction that has garnered a lot of media attention, given all the discussion around the future of retail. This is a good example of the type of contrarian investments we make during periods of market dislocation and when certain sectors are out of favor.

This acquisition will be transformative for BPY, creating one of the world&#39;s largest commercial real estate companies. Combining our deep operating expertise across multiple real estate sectors with GGP&#39;s portfolio of irreplaceable retail assets will enable us to unlock the value of these assets in a rapidly changing retail environment.

Notable Private Fund Transactions 
 
In the private funds world, last quarter we announced some notable investments across a number of markets. We are currently looking to close four transactions in the coming quarters, including two new private equity investments in Brookfield Capital Partners IV (&quot;BCP IV&quot;), and two initial investments in Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners III (&quot;BSREP III&quot;). Specifically:

In BCP IV, we agreed to acquire Westinghouse Electric Company, one of the world&#39;s leading suppliers of infrastructure services to nuclear power generating facilities for $4.6 billion, funded by BCP IV and Brookfield Business Partners. As a long-term business owner and operator of critical global infrastructure with deep facilities management capabilities, we will use our expertise to enhance Westinghouse&#39;s position as a leading global infrastructure services provider to the power generation business. 
 
Also in BCP IV, we agreed to acquire Schoeller Allibert Group B.V., one of Europe&#39;s largest manufacturers of returnable plastic packaging systems, for EUR 205 million. With an increased global focus on sustainability, waste reduction, e-commerce and logistics automation, the returnable packaging sector is positioned for meaningful growth. Our goal is to help this business expand internationally in a fast-growing market.
 
In BSREP III, we announced our intention to make our first investment for the fund in SACO, a European serviced apartment owner/operator with a 2,200 unit serviced apartment portfolio in major markets such as London, Edinburg and Amsterdam, for approximately Â£500 million. SACO represents our first foray into the serviced apartment sector, one we believe to be highly fragmented and undersupplied as consumers increasingly seek alternatives to traditional hotel accommodations. We plan to implement operational enhancements at the properties and expand into other markets in European gateway cities. 
 
Also in BSREP III, we announced our intention to acquire IC Campus, one of the largest developers and operators of student and young professional apartments in Europe, a market with unmet demand for this type of accommodation. Our goal is to use our operating expertise to build out the properties and scale the business in Europe.
 
And finally, late last year we sold Gazeley, a European industrial business acquired by BSREP I in 2013, to GLP, for $2.8 billion. This represented a 47% return on our investment of $508 million and was a great investment in the fast-growing logistics sector.
 

Closing
 
We remain committed to being a leading, world-class alternative asset manager. As stewards of your capital, our objective continues to be investing in high-quality assets that earn solid cash returns on equity, while emphasizing downside protection. 
As always, please do not hesitate to contact any of us should you have suggestions, questions, comments, or ideas you wish to share with us.
 


Sincerely,
